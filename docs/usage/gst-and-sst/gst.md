**Example 1:**
Company XY Sdn Bhd purchased 15 hampers worth RM200/hamper to be given to each of his employees.

- every employee will get one hamper FOC.
- no need to account for output tax.
- input tax on 15 hampers = RM180.00 (6% x RM3,000.00) is claimable.

**Example 2:**
Company CX Sdn Bhd has purchased a watch worth RM400.00 and gave it to one of the director’s son.

- The gift is not subject to GST because its value is less than RM500.00 (gift rule).
- input tax incurred on the purchase is claimable.

## GST Special Treatment

## GST Margin Scheme

How To Start the New Margin Scheme with Special Database?

GST is normally due on the full value of goods sold. The margin scheme allows a GST Margin Scheme registered person (GST MS registered person) who meets all the conditions to calculate and charge GST on the margin i.e. the difference between the price at which the goods were obtained and the selling price. If no margin is made (because the purchase price exceeds the selling price) then no GST is charged and payable.

For the purpose of GST, margin under this scheme means the difference between selling price and purchase price. If there is any value being added to the eligible goods such as cost for repairing, this cost is part of the margin other than profit. In other words, the value added must be included in the selling price and not the purchase price.

Therefore, we have designed a database structure specially for business which has margin scheme involvement.

### Modules Require

1. SQL Accounting Basic (GST compliance)
2. DIY field
3. DIY script
4. Project (use to record Car Plate number)

See below the overview of Margin Scheme process flow:

## GST Treatment: How to report GST-03 item 16 Capital Goods Acquired for Purchase of machinery from Oversea

### Case 1 : Purchase of Machinery (Fixed Asset) From Overseas

Let said the oversea supplier has send the bill amount USD15,000 (USD15,000 x 4.2 = Rm63,000 will recorded in the Account Book).
Understand that Custom will use GST valuation to compute the GST amt and stated in K1 form. Assume that GST Valuation after custom duty = Rm75,000 and GST amt Rm75,000 x 6% = Rm4,500.

**Question:**
Which amount should I reported in GST-03 item 16 Capital Goods Acquired? Rm63,000 or Rm75,000?

**Answer from RMCD:**
GST-03 item 16 Capital Goods Acquired = Rm75,000.

### How to handle this in SQL Accounting?

1. Oversea supplier bill enter at purchase/supplier invoice as usual.

   | Account          | Local DR  | Local CR  |
   |------------------|-----------|-----------|
   | Machinery        | 63,000.00 |           |
   | Oversea supplier |           | 63,000.00 |

2. When it comes to the forwarder bill after declaring the import goods, you must follow our GST Import Goods guideline. Refer to this link [1](../../usage/gst-and-sst/gst#gst-treatment-import-goods-im).

3. You just have to select Fixed Asset Account at the item line updated from the GST Imports screen. (**Don't worry, Rm75,000 fixed asset will not post into your account book**). See the screenshot attached.

   ![des-which-amount-to-report-in-gst03-item16-capital-goods-1](../../../static/img/usage/gst-and-sst/gst/which-amount-to-report-in-gst03-item16-capital-goods-1.jpg)

   :::note NOTE:

   For GST-03 purpose, this is to report into item 16 Capital Goods Acquired for the import of machinery value as stated in the K1 form. Your account book still recorded as Rm63,000 in step 1.

## GST Treatment: Free Industrial Zone(FIZ) and Licensed Manufacturing Warehouse(LMW)

This guide will teach you the way to key-in the data entry related to GST treatment on FIZ and LMW.
Under GST system, a person operating in a FIZ or having LMW status is treated as any person carrying out a business in Malaysia where normal rules of GST apply. This means that acquisition of goods locally or imported by the person operating in a FIZ or having LMW status is subject to GST. However, the person operating in a FIZ or having LMW status is eligible to apply for Approved Trader Scheme (ATS) to allow the Director General to suspend the payment of GST on imported goods at the time of importation. For further details, please refer to the guide on Approved Trader Scheme (ATS) and [SQL Accounting on ATS](http://www.sql.com.my/document/sqlacc_docs/PDF/GST36-Input_Entry_for_ATS.pdf)

Subject to GST:

1. Based on **transaction value**. GST = transaction value x (SR or ZR) %:

    1. FIZ Local sell to FIZ Local → SR
    2. FIZ local sell to LMW Local → SR
    3. FIZ/LMW Local sell to Oversea → ZR

2. Based on **the value of imported goods**. GST = (Custom Value + Import Duty) x SR %:

    1. FIZ/LMW local sell to non-FIZ/LMW → SR

   For example (**FIZ/LMW local sell to non-FIZ/LMW**),

   | Item | Item Description | Qty     | Unit Price (RM) | Value (RM) | Import Duty (RM) |
   |------|------------------|---------|-----------------|------------|------------------|
   | 1    | Shirts           | 300 pcs | 25.00           | 7,500.00   | **1,500.00**         |
   | 2    | Paints           | 100 pcs | 30.00           | 3,000.00   | **600.00**           |
   |      |                  |         |    **Total**    | 10,500.00  | **2,100.00**         |

   ***Assuming 20% import duty (RM10,500 x 20% = 2,100.00)***

   GST on value + Import Duty are subject to GST (SR) = (10,500.00 + 2,100.00) x 6% = **756.00**

   Therefore, the Tax Invoice will be presented as per below:

   | Item | Item Description | Qty     | Unit Price (RM) | Value (RM) |
   |------|------------------|---------|-----------------|------------|
   | 1    | Shirt            | 300 pcs | 25.00           | 7,500.00   |
   | 2    | Paints           | 100 pcs | 30.00           | 3,000.00   |
   |      | GST (SR-6%)  |         |                 | 756.00     |
   |      | Total Amount Payable | |                 | 11,256.00  |

### How to enter the Tax Invoice if there is a FIZ/LMW transactions to another party?

According to the example mentioned in above.

1. Insert and select the stock items sold with empty tax code. Because the stock items are under FIZ/LMW control.

   | Item Code | Description | Qty     | Unit Price | Subtotal | Tax Code | Tax Amount | SubTotal (Tax) |
   |-----------|-------------|---------|------------|----------|----------|------------|----------------|
   | SHIRT     | SHIRTS      | 300 pcs | 25.00      | 7,500.00 |   BLANK  | 0.00       | 7,500.00       |

## GST Treatment: Construction Business

This guide will teach you the way to enter the tax invoice to the Developer from Main Contractor.
Time to account for GST is at the either of the following:-

   1. when payment is received;
   2. when tax invoice is issued;
   3. if no tax invoice has been issued within 21 days after the certificate of work done is issued.

We have to look into and show the following items in order to calculate the GST amount in the Tax Invoice:

   1. Certified value - Progress claim value certified by Architect.
   2. Retention Amount - the amount of progress payment which is not paid until the conditions specified in the contract for the payment of such amounts have been met or until defects have been rectified.
   3. Progress payment

### Partial Exemption Rules

**Flowchart:**

![des-partial-exemption-rules-1](../../../static/img/usage/gst-and-sst/gst/partial-exemption-rules-1.jpg)

#### De Minimis Rule (DmR)

To satisfy the De Minimis Rule:

   1. Total Exempt Supply (ES) `<=` Average RM5,000.00 per month; **AND**
   2. DMR `<=` 5%

Formula:
DmR = [E / (T + E)] x 100%

| Supplies | Tax Code                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| T        | (SR + ZRL + ZDA + ZRE + DS + RS + GS + OS-TXM + NTX) | The total value (exclusive of GST) of all taxable supplies which are the sum of all standard-rated supplies, zero-rated supplies (Local), zero-rated supplies (Export), deemed taxable supplies, supplies made outside Malaysia which would be taxable if made in Malaysia, relief supplies, and disregarded supplies made in the taxable period. |
| E        | (ES)                                               | The total value (exclusive of GST) of exempt supplies made in the taxable period which NOT include incidental exempt supplies.                                                                                                                      |

:::note NOTE :

   (i) IES is only for incidental supplies, therefore will not be part of the de minimis rule formula (DmR).
   (ii) This formula functions is only to test the percentage and value that qualify for de minimis rule.
   (iii) Accounting software users should apply DmR on their TX-ES transactions.

The application for de minimis rule as stated below:
   (i) Application of incidental exempt supplies to the de minimis rule.
   (ii) Applying the de minimis rule in a taxable period.
   (iii) Applying the de minimis rule in a tax year or longer period.

The supplies related to **O2** of the IRR formula are as follows:

| Tax Code | Description |
|--------------|-----------------|
| SR | The value of any supply of capital assets used by the taxable person for the purposes of his business (e.g., an asset or part of an asset is disposed of as Transfer of Going Concern). |
| DS | Supplies made by a recipient in accordance with Approved Trader Manufacturer Scheme (ATMS) where self-recipient accounting is made by recipient. |
| DS | Supplies of imported services where reverse charge mechanism (RSA) is made by recipient. |
| OS | Out of scope supply is a supply which is not within the ambit or boundary of GST, and therefore GST is not chargeable on such supply. |
| ES | Exempt supplies of land for general use (Land used for burial, playground or religious building), and disposal of capital asset which is subject to exempt supplies. |

:::note Note:
(i) IES is only for incidental exempt supplies, therefore will not be part of the Input Tax Recoverable Ratio (IRR) formula.
(ii) For other excluded transactions ("O1 & O2"), users need to analyse their transactions in ES, SR, DS & OS,
then make necessary adjustment before they can apply the correct ratio.
(iii) Accounting software users should apply IRR on their TX-RE transactions.
(iv) The above formula is based on the value of supplies made which is the standard method used to apportion the residual input tax.
If the person wishes to use other methods to apportion the residual input tax, he is required to get approval from customs.

#### Input Tax Claimable Logic to TX-RE, TX-IES (TX-E43) & TX-ES (TX-N43) (Based on DMR)

Below is the summary of the calculation logic based on DMR to determine the input tax claimable.

| Tax Code | Tax Rate | Fulfill DMR? | Input Tax Claimable (ITC) |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| TX-RE    | 6%       | Yes          | ITC × 100%                |
| TX-RE    | 6%       | No           | ITC × IRR                 |
| TX-IES   | 6%       | N/A          | ITC × 100%                |
| TX-ES    | 6%       | Yes          | ITC × 100%                |
| TX-ES    | 6%       | No           | ITC × 0%                  |

### How to exclude the IRR for the capital goods disposed off?

For example, Mixed Co. Sdn Bhd., whose current tax year ends on 31 December 2016, has in his taxable period of April 2015, made some mixed supplies and at the same time incurred residual input tax as follows.

|  |                                            | `RM)` |
|-----|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| T   | Value of all taxable supplies, exclusive of tax       | 200,000.00  |
| E   | Value of all exempt supplies                          | 40,000.00   |
| O1 & O2 | Value of a capital goods disposal off (exclusive of tax) | 50,000.00   |
| O2  | Value of incidental exempt supplies                   | 20,000.00   |
|     | Residual Input Tax Incurred                           | 10,000.00   |

#### Steps

1. Go to GST | Maintain Tax...
2. Edit the **SR** tax code.
3. Click on the tax rate lookup. See the screenshot below.

    ![des-how-to-exclude-irr-for-the-capital-goods-disposed-off-steps-1](../../../static/img/usage/gst-and-sst/gst/how-to-exclude-irr-for-the-capital-goods-disposed-off-steps-1.jpg)

4. Click +' sign follow by **IRR Excluded** to insert additional tax rate 6% IRR excluded **(O)**.

   :::note **Note:**

   1. Tax Rate set as EA or E6%.
   2. E = Exclude from IRR formula.

   :::

5. Enter the disposal of asset in Customer Invoice.
6. Select tax code **SR**.
7. Select tax rate **E6%** to exclude from IRR calculation (It means **"O"** to the formula).

   ![des-how-to-exclude-irr-for-the-capital-goods-disposed-off-steps-2](../../../static/img/usage/gst-and-sst/gst/how-to-exclude-irr-for-the-capital-goods-disposed-off-steps-2.jpg)

8. You will found the IRR calculated (**88.24%**) and the GST-Listing breakdown by tax code as shown in the screenshot below.

   ![des-how-to-exclude-irr-for-the-capital-goods-disposed-off-steps-3](../../../static/img/usage/gst-and-sst/gst/how-to-exclude-irr-for-the-capital-goods-disposed-off-steps-3.jpg)

   **IRR calculation:**

   |  |                                            | Calculation                                 | RM |
   |------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|
   | t          | Value of all taxable supplies, exclusive of tax      | 100,000 (SR) + 50,000 (ZRL) + 50,000 (OS) | 200,000   |
   | e          | Value all of exempt supplies                          | 20,000 (ES) + 20,000 (IES)       | 40,000    |
   | o          | Value of a capital goods disposal off (exclusive of tax) | 50,000 (SR with tax rate E6%)   | 50,000    |
   | o          | Value of incidental exempt supplies                   | 20,000 (IES)                     | 20,000    |
   |            | Residual Input Tax Incurred                           | 166,666.66 x 6% (TX-RE)          | 10,000    |

9. Therefore, IRR = (200,000 -50,000) / (200,000 + 40,000) - (50,000 + 20,000) = 0.8824 (**88.24%**).
10. The amount of residual input tax can claim for the period is,

      Residual Input Tax Recovery % X Residual Input Tax = **88.24% x Rm10,000 (TX-RE) = Rm8,824.00**.

## GST Treatment: Imported Services

GST on **Imported Services** (Sec 13) is accounted by way of the reverse charge mechanism.

**Reverse Charge Mechanism** (also known as Self Recipient Accounting-RSA)

A supplier whoe does not belong in Malaysia and supplies services to a customer in Malaysia does not have to charge GST. However, the customer who received the services is required to account for GST by a reverse charge mechanism.

The recipient has to pay tax for the imported services he received and the same time claim input tax in his GST return. Reverse charge mechanism is an accounting procedure where a recipient (as the customer) of the supply, acts as both, the supplies and the recipient of the services.

**Example:**

1. Royalty fee charged in Malaysia by non resident business situated outside Malaysia from Jan - Dec 2016 = USD 200,000
2. Date of invoice = 10 March 2016
3. Bank prevailing rate = Rm2.50 (Date: 10 March 2016)

Calculation for GST:

1. Consideration for the supply @Rm2.50 = Rm500,000.00 + GST 6%
2. GST to be accounted by recipient @6% GST = Rm30,000.00

RSA:
Account GST output = Rm30,000.00
Claim GST Input = Rm30,000.00

***Time of Supply***

1. When supply are paid for (Date of payment made) - no longer
2. Start from **01 Jan 2016**, which ever is the earlier:-

   1. Payment made; or
   2. Invoice date.
