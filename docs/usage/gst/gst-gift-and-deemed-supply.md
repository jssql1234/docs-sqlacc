Company XY Sdn Bhd purchased 15 hampers worth RM200/hamper to be given to each of his employees.

- every employee will get one hamper FOC.
- no need to account for output tax.
- input tax on 15 hampers = RM180.00 (6% x RM3,000.00) is claimable.

**Example 2:**
Company CX Sdn Bhd has purchased a watch worth RM400.00 and gave it to one of the director’s son.

- The gift is not subject to GST because its value is less than RM500.00 (gift rule).

- the value of the goods is more than RM500.00.

**Example 4:**

For the purpose of accounting GST, the company has to use open market value of the goods now where the value of the goods is RM450.00, i.e. the value of the goods has depreciated.

- no need to account for output tax on the gift
- the value of the goods is less than RM500.00. (Gift rule applicable)

**Example 5:**
