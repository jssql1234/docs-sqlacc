Please ensure that the referenced documents are validated Self-Billed E-Invoices (Payment Voucher). If they are not, the system will be unable to find the reference, and the Self-Billed Refund Note reference field will automatically indicate not applicable and become an unreferenced Self-Billed Refund Note.
