#### Method 1 (Recommended)

It will be had 4 transactions

1. RM1000 - Post to `SL_CS` & (`P_DocNo`, `P_PaymentMethod` field is empty & `P_Amount`, `P_PaidAmount` field is 0)

2. RM700 by Cash - Post to `AR_PM`

2. RM200 by MasterCard - Post to `AR_PM`

3. RM100 by CreditCard - Post to `AR_PM`

## Extra Notes

- Both Full Tax & Simplified IV can use same Debtor Code as Not mention required Customer GST ID
- Government 5 cents Rounding Mechanism - NO Tax/GST Code

        - Default is `SR`
        - Will auto reverse once it being Knock-Off

- Doc Disc should proportion by sub total amt for mix tax code (See Cash Sales POS-DocDisc)

    Example
        - Doc Discount = 10% of Document Discount
        - Sub Total for SR = 150.24 => Disc (150.24 \* 10%) = 15.02
        - Sub Total for ZR = 988.88 => Disc (988.88 \* 10%) = 98.89

    0r

        - Doc Discount = 113.91
        - Sub Total for SR = 150.24 => Disc ((150.24/1139.12) \* 113.91) = 15.02
        - Sub Total for ZR = 988.88 => Disc ((988.88/1139.12) \* 113.91) = 98.89

- Mixed Supplies Tax Code
        - ES
        - TX-ES (Replace TX-N43)
        - TX-RE

- Realise Bad Debts Use CN as Normal
        - System will contra the provision bad debts done at GST-03 by 6 mth bad debts
        - Make sure Knock the actual Bad debts Invoice

- For Purchase Invoice(PI) MUST 1 by 1 post in (i.e. can't Group multi PI in 1 PI)

02. Timing issue as in SQL Acc the Qty is *ALWAYS* outdated cause real *Stock In/Out* is from the External Program(eg POS)

03. Data redundancy as 2 same data for different system

04. Avoid wasting time on Sync correctness stock data between 2 system
