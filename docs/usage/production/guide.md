### Stock Group

Stock -> Maintain Stock Group

Used to differentiate the types of stocks and the costing method used for the stock, e.g. raw materials, finished goods, etc.

To produce a chemical products, the costing calculation based on stock group:-

    1. Raw Materials

        Assign your Raw Material Purchase code, Cash Purchase code, Purchase Return code.

        - Costing Method : FIFO

        ![5](../../../static/img/getting-started/user-guide/production/setup/jj5.png)
    
    2. Water

        Assigned your Raw Material Purchase code, Cash Purchase code, Purchase Return code.

        - Costing Method : Fixed Costing

        ![6](../../../static/img/getting-started/user-guide/production/setup/jj6.png)

    3. Finished Goods
        
        Assigned your Finished Goods Purchase code, Cash Purchase code, Purchase Return code.
        
        - Costing Method : FIFO

        ![7](../../../static/img/getting-started/user-guide/production/setup/jj7.png)

### Stock Item

Stock -> Maintain Stock Item

Setup the stock item master data for all types of stock. Eg. raw materials, end products, trading products, etc.

    1. Create all your raw materials items and assigned stock group respectively.

        ![8](../../../static/img/getting-started/user-guide/production/setup/jj8.png)

    2. Create your finished goods item and assign raw materials.

        1. assigned stock group, enter based UOM, ref cost and ref price.

        2. go to the BOM tab, choose this product as a BOM item, and assign all the raw materials, quantity needed.

        Location is the Raw Materials kept and deducted from which warehouse.
        
        Overhead Cost is a fixed additional cost to the material cost incurred during each material process.
        
        Assembly Cost is a fixed cost incurred to the entire process for final products.

        ![9](../../../static/img/getting-started/user-guide/production/setup/jj9.png)

### Location (Warehouse)

Stock > Maintain Location

Define the warehouse code to identify the stock movement between the locations.

1. Receive raw materials from purchase and keep at the Raw Materials Warehouse.

2. Production uses the materials to produce the final products. Raw materials must be deducted from the Raw Materials Warehouse.

3. Final products will be kept at the Finished Goods Warehouse.

4. Work in progress stock kept in WIP Warehouse.

### Overview Workflow

Sales coordinator usually will input the Sales Order (SO) based on the customer PO received. The stock products will be updated into the system as ordered qty. If the stock is purchased from a supplier, then the purchaser has to transfer from SO to PO.

Unless the stock is manufactured, then you have to proceed to the Job Order process. How much of the materials/components required to meet the products ordered by the customer? This question was raised by the Material Planning department. Therefore, the Job Order takes place as the order to be input after the Sales Order. It will plan the materials/components required based on the qty ordered from Sales Order.

When products produce out, you have to transfer the Job Order to the Stock Assembly to commit the stock on hand.

|---|---|---|---|
|Car | Frame | Front Frame | Orange |
|Car | Frame | Front Frame | Screw |
|Car | Frame | Back Frame | Red Light |
|Car | Frame | Back Frame | Screw |

### Offset Qty In Sales Order

What is the purpose of the OFFSET Qty in Sales Order? You will see a new column named “OffSet Qty”. It allows you to input a value to increase/reduce the original QTY to be transferred to Purchase Order and Job Order.

![21](../../../static/img/getting-started/user-guide/production/jj21.png)

1. Positive Offset Qty

REDUCE the Transferable QTY to PO and JO.

For example,

|**SO Original Qty**|**Offset Qty**|**Transferable to PO/JO**|
|---|---|---|
|100.00 | 0.00 (default) | 100.00 |
|100.00 | +15.00 | 85.00 |

2. Negative Offset Qty

INCREASE the Transferable QTY to PO and JO.

For example,

|**SO Original Qty**|**Offset Qty**|**Transferable to PO/JO**|
|---|---|---|
|100.00 | 0.00 (default) | 100.00 |
|100.00 | -15.00 | 115.00 |

### Split to X Process

1. With this field, users are able to assign a number of processes/machines in one Job Order/Stock Item Assembly to produce the same End Products using the same range of BOM components.

![22](../../../static/img/getting-started/user-guide/production/jj22.png)

2. For example, To make a cup of MILO KAO KAO, it needs - MILO Powder x 5 spoons - Sugar x 0.5 spoon - Water x 100ml

In order to make 100 cups of milo from one Job Order created, we need 10 persons to make it more efficient. Therefore, we have to input "Split to 10 process(s)", it means 10 persons processing. Job Order will be break the BOM components into 10 processes like below:

|**No of process(s)** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** | **10** | **TOTAL** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|MILO POWDER | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 | 500 spoons |
|Sugar | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 50 spoons |
|Water | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 10000 ml |

NOTE: Preview and select the standard report name "Job Order 2 with Multiplier - 30 Columns (without cost)".

### BOM Tree Entry

1. Some manufacturing companies need to modify and overwrite the standard BOM structure during the entry stage. This button helps to add/remove the components to overwrite the BOM structure.

2. Click the "BOM Tree Entry" button.

![23](../../../static/img/getting-started/user-guide/production/jj23.png)

3. You can drill down all the BOM structures.

4. Tick the components in the tree you wish to insert into the Job Order/Stock Assembly/Disassembly.

5. Press OK to confirm.

![24](../../../static/img/getting-started/user-guide/production/jj24.png)

|**Button**|**Function**|
|---|---|
|Add | To add new components at LEVEL 1 ONLY |
|Add Child | To add new child components start from LEVEL 2 onwards |
|Delete | To remove the components at all LEVEL 1, 2, 3, 4, ... |
