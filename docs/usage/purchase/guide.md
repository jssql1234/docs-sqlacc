![formula-subtotal](../../../static/img/usage/purchase/guide/formula-subtotal.png)

:::note

   Item 1 = A/B * C

   Landing Cost1 (D) = 50.00 / 1949.00 * 200 = 5.13

   Item 2

   Landing Cost (D) = 1899.00 / 1949.00 * 200 = 194.87

:::

![stock-card-check-cost](../../../static/img/usage/purchase/guide/stock-card-check-cost.png)

:::note

   How to get unit cost = 5.51?

   Formula : Product Unit Cost + Item Landing Cost1 / Item Qty

   Formula : 5 + (5.13 / 10) = 5.51

:::

***Formula for Cost Allocated By Qty***

- Formula : Item Qty / Document Qty * Landing Cost1

![cost-allocated-by-quantity](../../../static/img/usage/purchase/guide/cost-allocated-by-quantity.png)

![formula-quantity](../../../static/img/usage/purchase/guide/formula-quantity.png)

:::note

   Item 1 : 10 / 11 * 200 = 181.81

   Item 2 : 1 / 11 * 200 = 18.18

:::

***Stock Card Report Outcome:***

:::note

   *Item ANT : unit cost will be 23.18, how to get 23.18 ?

   Unit Cost + (Landing Cost1 / Qty) = 5 + (181.82 / 10) = 23.18

   *Item LCLIP : Unit Cost will be 1917.18

   Unit Cost + (Landing Cost1 / Qty) = 1899 + (18.18 / 1) = 1917.18

:::

***Formula for Cost Allocated By Smallest Qty***

- Formula : Item Qty *Rate/ Sum(Qty* Rate) * Landing Cost1

![cost-allocated-by-smallest-quantity](../../../static/img/usage/purchase/guide/cost-allocated-by-smallest-quantity.png)

![formula-smallest-quantity](../../../static/img/usage/purchase/guide/formula-smallest-quantity.png)

:::note

   Item 1 : 10 * 12 = 120 / 121 = 198.35

   Item 2 : 1 * 1 = 1 / 121 = 1.65

:::

***Stock Card Report Outcome***

:::note

   Item 1 : Unit cost for ANT = [Unit Price + (Item Landing Cost1 / Item Qty)] / ItemRate = [30 + (198.35 / 10)] / 12 = 4.15

   Item 2 : Unit cost for LCLIP = [Unit Price + (Item Landing Cost1 / Item Qty)] / ItemRate = 1899 + 1.65 = 1900.65
