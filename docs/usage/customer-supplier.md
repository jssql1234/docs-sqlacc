### Customer Invoice vs Sales Invoice

The difference between Customer Invoice and Sales Invoice:

|**Customer Invoice**| **Sales Invoice**|

|shows only the accounts code and does not show Qty / Unit Price.| linked to the stock and account modules. Hence, we advise users who need to key in stock items to use Sales Invoice. Once the information in the Sales Invoice is updated, the information in the Customer Invoice will automatically be updated by the system.|

## Customer Contra

If you have a customer who is also a supplier, you may want to offset the outstanding customer and supplier invoices. This is known as a contra entry. You can offset the two invoices by using Customer Contra and Supplier Contra. This means that when you record the invoices as being paid, it will not affect your current bank account balance.

**Scenario:**

**If you have an outstanding sales invoice for RM200 and a purchase invoice for RM150 for the same customer or company, the actual amount owed to you is RM50 and the contra entry amount is RM150.**

### Make sure you have a valid `Contra Account`

1. Tools | Options

      4b. Enter Contra Amount (Must be same as Customer Contra Amount)
