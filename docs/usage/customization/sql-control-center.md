            T.Interval := 1000; // = 1 sec
            T.OnTimer  := @OnTimer;

            with L1 do begin
              Parent     := TWinControl(C);
              Width      := 66;

              Top        := 350;
              Caption    := 'Outstanding';
              Font.Color := clBlue;
              Font.Style := [fsBold];
            end;
            with L2 do begin

            end;
          end;
        end.
        ```

10. Click Save button.

### Result Test (Outstanding Amount)

1. Create a new sales invoice, eg. Invoice Amount = Rm1060.00

    ![new-salesinvoice-with-amount](../../../static/img/miscellaneous/sqlControlCenter/new-salesinvoice-with-amount.png)

2. Make a payment amount = Rm636.00 and knock-off with the invoice created in step 01.

    ![payment](../../../static/img/miscellaneous/sqlControlCenter/payment.png)

3. You can get the document outstanding balance (Rm1060.00 - Rm636.00 = Rm424.00) at Sales Invoice.
