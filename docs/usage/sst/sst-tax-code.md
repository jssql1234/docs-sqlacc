## Tariff Code

- Tariff classification is a complex yet extremely important aspect of cross-border trading.
- Goods imported from or to Malaysia are classified by the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) or commonly referred to as HS Codes.
- The codes, created by World Customs Organization (WCO), categorize up to 5,000 commodity
- HS Codes are made of 6-digit numbers that are recognized internationally, though different countries can extend the numbers by two or four digits to define commodities at a more detailed level.
