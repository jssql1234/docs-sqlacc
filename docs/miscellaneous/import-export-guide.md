## Import

### Import Sequence

The import sequence must always be followed to ensure data integrity:

1. **Master Data** (Import first)
2. **Transactions** (Import after master data; the system will process automatically)

:::warning[Avoid Duplicate Stock Movements]

- Importing both Sales DO and Sales IV will cause double stock deduction

- Importing both Purchase GRN and Purchase IV will cause double stock addition

:::

### Examples

**Master Data** (Import first):

- Maintain Customer, Supplier, Stock Item, Stock Group
- Maintain Agent, Area, Project, Currency
- And more...

**Transactions** (Import after master data):

- Sales documents (DN, IV, DO, SO, QT, CN)
- Cash Sales, Customer IV/DN/Payment/CN/Refund
- Customer Contra, Supplier Contra, GL Official Receipt

   4. Click the `Import` button

### Error: Invalid Callee

**Solution:**

2. Click `Tools` > `Options` > `General` > `Register`
3. Exit SQL Account and log on again
4. Retry your import/export

### Error: Field Currency Rate

This error occurs when replacing an invoice (IV) that has already been knocked off. You will need to resolve this manually.

### Error: Attempt to Import EX 15 Failed

If you encounter this error message:
`Access violation at address 0043B65F in module 'Import.exe'. Read of address 0000000.`

**Solution:**
Check if you have any DIY Fields in the source database and ensure the destination database has the same DIY Fields configured.
