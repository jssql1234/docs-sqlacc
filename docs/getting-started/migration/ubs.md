### Import Opening Balance

#### Year End Closing at UBS

1. Before importing Opening Balance, login into UBS and perform the following steps:-

- Old Version = Go to `Housekeeping | Run Setup | General Setting` (check when is the accounting period) then insert " Closing Period".
- Sage UBS = Go to `Housekeeping | Setup | General Setup` (check when is the accounting period) then insert " Closing Period".

**Scenario 1** : In UBS this accounting year = 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2015 if you want to cut off until 31/12/2015, so closing period you have to insert 12. __Scenario 2__ : In UBS this accounting year = 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2015 if you want to cut off until 30/06/2015, so closing period you have to insert 6.
Then, go to `Periodic | Year End Closing`.

:::info

We strongly recommend that direct use the year end database to import instead of re-do the year end cut off at UBS.
